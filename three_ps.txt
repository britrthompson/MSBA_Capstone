Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Updated code to look at the current math placement success rate and then built multiple classification models using the current 
math placement variables. Wrote a few pages of paper.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
If I should add in the levels analysis. Feeling like I don't have time to do that, so I'll likely decide this is my finalized code.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Complete my paper draft. Determine what I would like my visualization to be.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Updated statistical model code to loop through the identified predictor variables. 

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
The correct model to use to assist the math department on determining the appropriate thresholds for the different math levels. If their 
current model does not seem to be aligned with student success.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Create code for the correct model and work on paper updates.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Received updated data from Office of Planning and Analysis to include SAT and ACT scores. Updated code to incorporate SAT and ACT.

current model does not seem to be aligned with student success.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Figure out the correct model and work on more paper updates.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Met with the math department to get a better understanding of their current model and see if it would be useful to SAT and ACT as part of the
model. Updated course and combo code to only include students that aren't taking the required labs in the course category and include them in 
the combo category. Added in course level code, as students are placed into a level and not a specific course. Regression code at the course 
level was added. Wrote some data explanation on the paper.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
What my finalized product would be and how to get the gpa and erm score thresholds from the models I'm running - HELP!!!
 I'm thinking an updated flow chart for the math department as a finalized product.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
The math department has requested an analysis of how accurate their current ACT, SAT, ACT + hs_GPA and SAT + hs_GPA placement is. I don't 
currently have SAT and ACT data. So, I've e-mail the Office of Planning and Analysis to see if I can get additional data. In the meantime
I plan to continue working on coding and my paper.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Updated python code to include a for loop to run the best model for each course and added in additional code that predicts individual
student success and places the student based on their highest level of course with success. Sent an e-mail to the math department requesting additional 
information on the current models and exploring potentially adding additional models using ACT and SAT as predictors.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
How to get the course predictor to work correctly. Course assignment seems to be off.
If I should update the code to incorporate multiple models or stick with a model that only looks at high school GPA and Ed Ready scores.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Determine if additional models should be built and start incorporating them into the code. Will also, need to get updated data from OPA that
includes SAT and ACT information. Also, sort out issues with current course prediction code.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Requested feedback for the correct model to use high school GPA and Ed Ready Scores to place students into a course then use historical grades
to test accuracy. Reached out to John Chandler for added feedback and am awaiting a reply. Wrote 2 more pages of draft paper. Met with the 
admission office to understand how the math placements are communicated out to the students.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
Finding the correct model to use.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Find the correct model and implement.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
I was able to get the Ed Ready Scores and add them to the math_placement information. I've completed a classification tree analysis, random forest, XG Boost, as well as a logistical regression.
I also start the intro to the paper component of this course.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I'm struggling with understanding how to predict course placement based on high school GPA and Ed Ready scores, using grade outcomes as a measure of success.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Figure out what the most accurate statistical model is for this situation.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Created a GitHub repo. Read in data into Jupyter notebook and started cleaning data and categorizing grade outcomes.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
The Ed Ready score appears to be missing from the data. I e-mailed the individuals that have this information.
Inquired about where the data exists. Banner or Ed Ready? If not in Banner can this be cross walked with current data?

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Hopefully get the Ed Ready score data and start working on additional data clean up and the analysis. 

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?
3 hours + 5 hours over winter break to understand available data and what data was relevant to this analysis.
