Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Updated python code to include a for loop to run the best model for each course and added in additional code that predicts individual
student success and places the student based on their highest level of course with success. Sent an e-mail to the math department requesting additional 
information on the current models and exploring potentially adding additional models using ACT and SAT as predictors.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
How to get the course predictor to work correctly. Course assignment seems to be off.
If I should update the code to incorporate multiple models or stick with a model that only looks at high school GPA and Ed Ready scores.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Determine if additional models should be built and start incorporating them into the code. Will also, need to get updated data from OPA that
includes SAT and ACT information. Also, sort out issues with current course prediction code.

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?
6 hours.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Requested feedback for the correct model to use high school GPA and Ed Ready Scores to place students into a course then use historical grades
to test accuracy. Reached out to John Chandler for added feedback and am awaiting a reply. Wrote 2 more pages of draft paper. Met with the 
admission office to understand how the math placements are communicated out to the students.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
Finding the correct model to use.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Find the correct model and implement.

I was able to get the Ed Ready Scores and add them to the math_placement information. I've completed a classification tree analysis, random forest, XG Boost, as well as a logistical regression.
I also start the intro to the paper component of this course.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I'm struggling with understanding how to predict course placement based on high school GPA and Ed Ready scores, using grade outcomes as a measure of success.

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Figure out what the most accurate statistical model is for this situation.

Progress: What you have accomplished since last week’s post?
Created a GitHub repo. Read in data into Jupyter notebook and started cleaning data and categorizing grade outcomes.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
The Ed Ready score appears to be missing from the data. I e-mailed the individuals that have this information.
Inquired about where the data exists. Banner or Ed Ready? If not in Banner can this be cross walked with current data?

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Hopefully get the Ed Ready score data and start working on additional data clean up and the analysis. 

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?
3 hours + 5 hours over winter break to understand available data and what data was relevant to this analysis.
