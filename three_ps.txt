I was able to get the Ed Ready Scores and add them to the math_placement information. I've completed a classification tree analysis, random forest, XG Boost, as well as a logistical regression.
I also start the intro to the paper component of this course.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
I'm struggling with understanding how to predict course placement based on high school GPA and Ed Ready scores, using grade outcomes as a measure of success.

Figure out what the most accurate statistical model is for this situation.

Created a GitHub repo. Read in data into Jupyter notebook and started cleaning data and categorizing grade outcomes.

Problems: What are you stuck on or struggling with?
The Ed Ready score appears to be missing from the data. I e-mailed the individuals that have this information.
Inquired about where the data exists. Banner or Ed Ready? If not in Banner can this be cross walked with current data?

Plans: What do you intend to accomplish between now and next week’s post?
Hopefully get the Ed Ready score data and start working on additional data clean up and the analysis. 

How many hours did you spend working on your Capstone since last week’s post?
3 hours + 5 hours over winter break to understand available data and what data was relevant to this analysis.
